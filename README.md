# to-do-list
A to-do list with filtering + a theme switcher


You can enter any text value into the form and the value will be placed into an object and loaded to the to-do list

Each object has an ID to enable filterering using array methods such as find and filter. This enables the user to use the filter buttons to break down the list as they see fit.

a clear completed items button filters out all obejcts with a "complete" property in the list, and re-loads the new array back to the container.

The sun icon updates the css custom properties for the page to switch the colour theme from dark to light and back again.
